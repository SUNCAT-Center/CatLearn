# Linear models

This tutorial is intended to give further intuition for Gaussian processes.

Like in tutorial 1, we set up a known underlying function, generate training and test data and calculate predictions and errors. We will compare the results of linear ridge regression, Gaussian linear kernel regression and finally a Gaussian process with the popular squared exponential kernel.

Note how well the linear models do with little data, while the GP needs much more data, when the underlying function is linear.
