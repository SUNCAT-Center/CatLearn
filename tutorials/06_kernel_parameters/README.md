# Kernel tutorials

In this set of tutorials, we look at the different kernels for modeling a toy
function. The impact of the parameters on prediction accuracy is also
considered. This is achieved through varying hardcoded parameters and plotting
the effect on the predicted function.

It is recommended that the iPython notebook is used. Though a pure Python
implementation is also included.
