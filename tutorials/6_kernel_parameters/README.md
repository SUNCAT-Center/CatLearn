# Kernel tutorials

In this set of tutorials, we look at the different kernels for modeling a toy function. The impact of the parameters on prediction accuracy is also considered. This is achieved through varying hardcoded parameters and plotting the effect on the predicted function.

It is recommended that the iPython notebook is used. Though a pure Python implementation is also included.
