# Uncertainties

This tutorial demonstrates the uncertainty estimates on predictions.

First we set up the same known underlying function as in example 3, generate training and test data and calculate predictions and uncertainty estimates for every prediction. We will compare error intervals of Gaussian linear kernel regression and the Gaussian process with the popular squared exponential kernel.
