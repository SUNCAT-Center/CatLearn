CatLearn_ provides utilities for building and testing atomistic machine learning models for surface science and catalysis.

.. note:: This is part of the SUNCAT centers code base for understanding materials for catalytic applications. Other code is hosted on the center's Github_ repository.

-------------------

CatLearn provides an environment to facilitate utilization of machine learning within the field of materials science and catalysis. Workflows are typically expected to utilize the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE_), or NetworkX_ graphs.
Through close coupling with these codes, CatLearn can generate numerous embeddings for atomic systems. As well as generating a useful feature space for numerous problems, CatLearn has functions for model optimization. Further, Gaussian
processes (GP) regression machine learning routines are implemented with additional functionality over standard implementations such as that in scikit-learn.
A more detailed explanation of how to utilize the code can be found in the Tutorials_ folder.

To featurize ASE atoms objects, the following lines of code can be used::

    import ase
    from ase.cluster.cubic import FaceCenteredCubic

    from catlearn.fingerprint.setup import FeatureGenerator

    # First generate an atoms object.
    surfaces = [(1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)]
    layers = [6, 9, 5]
    lc = 3.61000
    atoms = FaceCenteredCubic('Cu', surfaces, layers, latticeconstant=lc)

    # Then generate some features.
    generator = FeatureGenerator(nprocs=1)
    features = generator.return_vec([atoms], [generator.eigenspectrum_vec,
                                              generator.composition_vec])

In the most basic form, it is possible to set up a GP model and make some predictions using the following lines of code::

    import numpy as np
    from catlearn.regression import GaussianProcess

    # Define some input data.
    train_features = np.arange(200).reshape(50, 4)
    target = np.random.random_sample((50,))
    test_features = np.arange(100).reshape(25, 4)

    # Setup the kernel.
    kernel = {'k1': {'type': 'gaussian', 'width': 0.5}}

    # Train the GP model.
    gp = GaussianProcess(kernel_dict=kernel, regularization=1e-3,
                         train_fp=train_features, train_target=target,
                         optimize_hyperparameters=True)

    # Get the predictions.
    prediction = gp.predict(test_fp=test_features)
